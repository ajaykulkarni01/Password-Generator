# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project, I've developed an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

This is my third week of the bootcamp. In this week, I learnt some of the advanced Javascript skills which I've implemented while working on this application.

I was presented with the starter code and following acceptance criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Features:

- Variable declaration area
- An event listener (onclick) called generatePassword
  - This will prompt the user for input between 8-128
  - This variable is changed to an interger using ParseInt()
  - This will validate that the input is a number within range, or is a number
  - This then uses the input to determine the types (or choices) or letters of characters used, using an if statement
  - This then assigns values to the variables using arrays for character, number or alphabet
- Another variable is created to concatenate the above variables
- A for loop will loop through the enter prompt until it reaches the number entered by user.
- A password variable takes the value from the for loop, and converts it to a string.
- The string value then populates into the text area for the user using a UserInput function.
